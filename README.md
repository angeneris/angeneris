## Hi, I’m Angeneris! 👋🏽<br>

👩🏾‍🎓 I hold a B.A. in Psychology and Education and started coding in 2021 while teaching Middle School English and History. <br>
📚 This Fall, I'm returning to school to take Computer Science and Math courses while completing the Data Science bootcamp at TripleTen.<br>
🌟 My main interests lie in machine learning and AI, so I primarily work with Python and SQL.<br>
🌱 One of my goals this year is to strengthen my skills in testing and web development, focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.<br>
